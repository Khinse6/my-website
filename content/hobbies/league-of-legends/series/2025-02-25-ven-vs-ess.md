# VEN vs ESS | 2025-02-25

## Game 1

### Pre-game
- Runes - Rumble should take demolish instead of overgrowth / unflinching, Nocturne should take coup de grace + sudden impact instead of last stand + grisly mementos, Galio demolish instead of shield bash
- Boots - We should NOT upgrade boots besides swiftness and symbiotic

### Timings

- **04:40** - Galio W DOES NOT work on minions + Galio Q should hit all the wave, not just the casters
- **04:55** - Sylas should recall after getting the cannon minion
- **05:00** - Galio shoulg go mid by lane instead of going around, he needs to get there asap since sylas needs to recall
- **05:25** - Nice E Sylas KEKW
- **05:50** - Rumble is on Disneyland?Wasting abilities on air, enemy supp, jng and mid is missing why go down the river? Ruymble should ward top tribush and check if he is gonna get dove, if so just recall or trade 1 for 1 (not worth it)
- **07:10** - After bot 2v2 we should recall since enemy jungle is missing while ours is topside
- **07:25** - Adc should not ward tribush since it will always be cleared, instead should ward blastcone from dragon pit or krugs bush into the lane
- **09:10** - Why are we hitting the wave on botside?
- **10:05** - We ALWAYS respect the bounce when we don't have vision on enemy jungler
- **13:00** - Sylas should just use J4 R on Orianna sooners, she had no seraph's shield and no flash
- **13:30** - Mechanical error by galio, he could hold W more time and not auto the minnion
- **14:50** - Galio should R with Nocturne R, varus should flash upwards to make a 3v2 instead of downwards to make a 3v3, nice Sylas E xdd
- **17:00** - Herald could have been started sooner (when sylas called orianna was out)
- **18:00** - Weird Nocturne engage (are you inting or what?), nice game throw gg go next, we were 1k gold ahead and because of that play we gave 4 kills and mid turret
- **20:10** - Rumble should just R the wave instead of waiting to get dovex
- **20:20** - Why are we on river if we are not contesting objective? We should rotate mid and get t2 and maybe t3
- **21:00** - Nocturne should have stayed with team or just prevent kennen from taking t2 top, we should recall after taking enemy jungle camps instead of chasing kennen
- **23:00** - 2 Blue wards up and we don't use any to rotate safely, losing us the fight and the drake, do not rotate without vision vs dashes from enemy team

## Game 2

### Pre-game

- Runes - Gnar should take second wind instead of bone plating and alacarity + cut down instead of triumph + coup de grace, Maokai should take conditioning + overgrowth instead of bone plating + unflinching and boots instead of biscuits, Seraphine should take scorch instead of gathering storm
### Timings
- **00:00** - When you have champions with dashes, only upgrade the ability when waves meet in lane mto watch out for invades
- **02:30** - Do NOT beak the bounce in botlane
- **04:35** - Nice waste of time on toplane, the initial 5 seconds were fine but after that we wast 40 seconds on toplane just 4fun
- **06:00** - We should not hit the top tower neither the wave here, just rotate to grubs with maokai, we have no info on kha'zix he could be topside
- **08:20** - Whyy are we hitting top turret? Crarsh the wave into recall to match urgot tempo, if enemy urgot was better he would not lose anything
- **08:30** - After kha'zix leaves the red buff, play is over we should just fall back, viktor is in a weird position
- **12:10** - Seraphine should be behind the minions while poking
- **12:45** - We know kha'zix is botside, whyy is viktor face checking a bush?
- **14:30** - After shoving mid wave, botlane should recall instead of hitting the turret
- **14:50** - Botlane facechecks a bush when they have no wards
- **18:00** - Gnar too greedy to hit the tower, should just afk in bush, get vision instead of trading hp for a demolish proc or just recall and buy black cleaver?
- **19:30** - Gnar dies on a bad timer, gives enemy urgot 500g from shutdown + 250g from tower, sells Dblade to buy black cleaver and leaves the base with 180g (the gold that selling dblade gives)
- **19:50** - Seraphine is inting by hitting the wave (poking the enemies) without vision
- **20:25** - Gnar 101 use E on minions or herald before mega to get double jump and slow on enemies getting a free R and W on them
- **22:05** - Flipping a 1v1 on botside instead of taking the farm
- **22:30** - Mid and bot should zone kha'zix from objectiuve and maokai should R sooner
- **23:30** - After taking the tower we should all recall at the same time on the lane
- **24:45** - Bas flip on urgot, it could cost us the objective + trading hp before objective with someone who was tp is bad
- **25:25** - The drak fight could have been cleaner (Seraphine + Ashe R xdd) 
- **26:00** - Viktor stays bot and gets tower, Ashe Seraphine and Maokai should recall and go baron
- **27:40** - What should be a free baron turns into a flip losing 3 turrets bot and inib (Bounties are diff), enemy team gets even on gold
