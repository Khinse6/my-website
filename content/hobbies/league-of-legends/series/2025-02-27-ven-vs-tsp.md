# VEN vs TSP | 2025-02-27
## Game 1
### Pre-game
- JPath - Always start on a Blue or Red buff (everyone does it), you will walk less overall to clear the camps
- Builds - K'sante could opt for [shield build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL_wOzwv8Jo) since enemies are mixed damage, have no shield shred and are 4 melees
### Timings
- **00:35** - K'sante sees enemy supp and jungle invading and is afk, your position in the bush is not the bes either you should be as close as possible to the wall of the baron pit there you can see the enemies sooner
- **01:30** - Poppy should start the clear in red buff not in the raptors
- **02:00** - Akali should watch out for lvl spikes and all ins, just flash the cc to be safe
- **03:00** - K'sante shoul play safer after a bad trade (learn trading patterns and mana managment)
- **03:40** - After Poppy calls to give bot scuttle to enemy jungle, Braum and Ezreal should play safe instead of forcing a trade 2v3 and losing the lane
- **03:50** - Why is Akali fighting enemy mid laner while 1 lvl down???
- **07:30** - Akali is winning trades while 1 lvl down (champ diff ig), but why does she not W enemy Yasuo Q3 ?
- **08:40** - Mid laners arrive mid on same time after recall, enemy mid lane shoves the wave faster and roams (there are no comms about this)
- **09:15** - Ezreal should not comment on teammates plays in the other side of the map
- **09:50** - Akali put his 1st ward YEY
- **10:15** - Why does Braum stays mid and then goes to grubs when enemy mid is dead and enemy jungler is botside and we know enemies can only do one play on the game, dive bot
- **10:40** - Ezreal should leave turret since Braum is late and adapt to the game
- **11:15** - Akali should take one more wave then rotate
- **12:00** - Why is Akali watching enemy mid laner farm the wave for free and does not rotate with the team?
- **12:45** - Why doesn't Braum wait for gold in base instead of wandering around?
- **12:50** - Ezreal should watch out for cheese playes on botlane and go to lane close to the outside wall
- **14:30** - We see 4 guys going bot lane instead of taking mid turret and Braum stays mid to farm (???) instead of coming bot or just saying they are rotating sooner. Ezreal should once again just give turret and adapt to the game
- **15:15** - Why does Braum go bot here instead of helping mid protect mid turret
- **15:45** - Why does Poppy fights 1v1 vs a fed enemy mid laner here? (Akali is out)

- **20:40** - Good fight but then K'sante and Akali stay on the map and Poppy and braum recall to match enemy tempo on the map

## Game 2
### Pre-game
### Timings
- **02:00** - Viktor wasting abilities on enemy mid laner (and missing) instead of hitting the wave while hitting the enemy mid laner at the same time
- **02:10** - Why does Nautilus engage on enemy team lvl 2 spike when we call before to give them wave pressure
- **04:20** - Nautilus positioning on lane, never STAY between the turret and outside tower, it gives the enemies free ability hits
- **05:10** - Bot lane shenanigans why are we still fighting + hook missing
- **05:20** - Viktor should just communicate with Sejuani and ask help to shove the wave and not waste tp
- **07:55** - Why is Nautilus contesting wave vs enemy bot lane?
- **08:05** - Nice trade (Nautilus for enemy adc), but we can't crash the wave since enemy jungler is matching ours and should be bot side
- **09:40** - Bad call to crash the wave, we don't need to keep the pressure since drake is almost done and we should just accept the bounce hoping for a Sejuani play
- **10:30** - Viktor should just E the whole wave
- **11:25** - Enemy mid goes bot, catches mid wave and rotates first to the grubs while our mid laner catches a single wave while arriving late for grubs + late tp (fight was over, Viktor should have used tp sooner)
- **13:40** - Nautilus saving spells for next game
- **15:00** - Nautilus using flash to hide the body
- **17:40** - Corki shoul catch the wave defensively (under turret) instead of inting
